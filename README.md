# __Test task__
### Create applications to test password strength.

# __The essence of the assignment:__

    ● Create a field for entering a password, under the field add 3 sections which will show the strength of the password;
    ● Changes in password strength must take place in real time;

    ● How to calculate the strength of a password:
       - Only letters/digits/symbols - the password is easy;
       - Combination of letters-symbols/letters-digits/digits-symbols - the password is medium;
       - Has letters, symbols and numbers - the password is strong;


    ● The color of the sections will depend on the strength of the password:
       - If the field is empty, all sections are gray;
       - If the field has less than 8 characters, all sections are red;
       - If the password is easy - the first section is red the rest are gray;
       - If the password is medium - the first two sections are yellow the last one is gray;
       - If the password is strong, all sections are green;
